		   <title>Notion Lyrics</title>

		   <p><b>Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion</b><br>
			<strong>But I don't need the comfort of any lies</strong><br>
			For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending<br>
			Rise</p><br><br>
		   <p>Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters<br>
			That my end will be torture beneath the earth<br>
			'Cause I don't see what they see, when death is staring at me<br>
			I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all</p><br><br>
		   <p>If you could pull the lever to carry on forever<br>
			Would your life even matter anymore?<br>
			Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion<br>
			But it's not what you signed up for</p><br><br>
		   <p>I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br>
			But there's this momentary beam of light<br>
			You don't have to wait those salty decades<br>
			To get through the gate, it's all in front of your face</p><br><br>
		   <p>I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br>
			I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br>
			But there's this momentary beam of light</p><br><br>
		   <p>I could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion<br>
			For every shining second, this fragile body beckons<br>
			You think you're owed it better believing ancient letters<br>
			Sure it's a calming notion, but it's a lie...</p><br><br>
